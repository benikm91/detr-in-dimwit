/** Transcribes documents: the nodes of each one at a time, then the relationships between them.
  *
  * Nothing but the document goes in, and every step reads back only what the model itself has
  * taken, so no target record can reach what is written down.
  *
  * A slot's queries each answer with a different remaining node, and the pool is read as a whole:
  * at every slot the answer the model gives the highest log probability is written down — the
  * score of its class plus the score of each coordinate the class places — and never looked back
  * on. The relationships are written the same way, reading the nodes as the node decoder carried
  * them.
  *
  * A batch of drawings is transcribed in lockstep and as a single traced computation — the
  * encoder, every decoding step and both scorers together — so a batch costs one compiled call
  * rather than one dispatch per operation per step per drawing. `drawings` is how wide that batch
  * is; a call handing over fewer is filled up with a drawing it already holds and read back short
  * again, so that every batch is the same shape. The parameters are an argument, so the one
  * compiled computation serves every batch of every checkpoint.
  *
  * A drawing takes its nodes one slot after the other, in one `scan` over the slots, and then its
  * relationships in a second one; a step reads what the slots before it have taken from the
  * decoders' caches rather than reading them again. A drawing that has answered
  * [[NodeClass.NoNode]] takes nothing more, and the slots it would have filled hold nothing — which
  * is what a position a record does not reach holds anyway. Its relationships stop the same way at
  * [[EdgeClass.NoEdge]].
