"""The synthetic floor plans, as the arrays DimWit lifts them from. Everything else happens in Scala.

The dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/benikm91/synthetic-floorplans-for-transcription) ships
its splits as plain repository files: ``{part}_images.npy`` holds ``(N, 512, 512)`` uint8 drawings
(row index = y, white background, dark ink) and ``{part}_labels.jsonl`` one record per line, in the
same order. A split is one part or, for train, the parts ``train-00`` to ``train-08``;
``metadata.json`` lists every part and how many plans it holds.

A record holds its nodes -- each a class and the two ends of a segment, in the pixels of the drawing
-- and its relationships, each naming two nodes by their position.
