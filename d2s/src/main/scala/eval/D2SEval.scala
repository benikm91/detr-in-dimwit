/** Transcribes documents into the set of nodes they hold, one node at a time.
  *
  * Nothing but the document goes in, and every step reads back only what the model itself has
  * taken, so no target record can reach what is written down.
  *
  * A slot's queries each answer with a different remaining node, and the pool is read as a whole:
  * at every slot the answer the model gives the highest log probability is written down — the
  * score of its class plus the score of each coordinate the class places — and never looked back
  * on.
  *
  * A batch of drawings is transcribed in lockstep and as a single traced computation — the
  * encoder, every decoding step and the scorer together — so a batch costs one compiled call
  * rather than one dispatch per operation per step per drawing. `drawings` is how wide that batch
  * is; a call handing over fewer is filled up with a drawing it already holds and read back short
  * again, so that every batch is the same shape. The parameters are an argument, so the one
  * compiled computation serves every batch of every checkpoint.
  *
  * A drawing takes its nodes one slot after the other, in one `scan` over the slots, and a step
  * reads what the slots before it have taken from the decoder's caches rather than reading them
  * again. A drawing that has answered [[NodeClass.NoNode]] takes nothing more, and the slots it
  * would have filled hold nothing — which is what a position a record does not reach holds
  * anyway. So where a transcription stops is a value rather than a branch, and the drawings of a
  * batch are spread over by `vmap` with nothing read back to the host until all are written down.
